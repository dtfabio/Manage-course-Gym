# Software for manage course in a Gym

Jimmy is a body building instructor and needs a program to manage the courses provided by his gym, the Air's Gym. Specifically, the program must make the following features available

1. Inserting a new course. A course is characterized by a code (alphanumeric), a name, an instructor and a maximum number of participants (between a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 50).

2. Membership of a new customer. A customer is characterized by a code, a name, a surname and an age and a sex. The code consists of two parts: a letter indicating the type of subscription, B (children aged between 6 and 12 years), M (men over the age of 12) and F (women over the age of 12), and a numerical progressive. The customer's code is automatically generated upon insertion and must be displayed on the screen immediately after the new customer's membership.

3. View the courses delivered by the gym. It is necessary to view the code, the name of the course and the number of enrolled students.

4. Display of members. It is necessary to view the code, surname and name of each cardholder.

5. Registration of a card to a course. The functionality takes the customer's code and the course code as input, displays the information relating to the codes entered (i.e. customer's name and surname and course name) and asks for confirmation of registration.
